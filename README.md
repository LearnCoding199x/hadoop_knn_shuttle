### File code in solve package so create a new java project and create solve package and copy all code file to the package.
### After that,build the project -> get a jar file.
### Run hadoop jar < path to jar file > < path to test file > < Name > < path to train file > < output path >
## IMPORTANT : test and train file must put into hdfs ...
### You can using other datasets by changing the list_labels in code file but all features must be integer ( if not , needed to do some code ).
